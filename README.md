# project-acessibility
The assignment was to make my existing project acessible. I had lots of problem with the branches to push the changes and after many errors I decided to create a new repo from scratch and then pasted the code in here insetad. 
It as fun making the site accessible. From the begning it had a scoring of 90% in lighthouse and after following intructions to make it make the site accessible it scored 100%. 

The changes I made to make a 100% score was to use proper HTML tags instead of just "<div>. I used tags like <header>, <main>, <section> and so on. Also added lang="en" and proper alt attributes. My colour contrast was well adjusted from the begining so I'm happy that I didn't need to change colour in order to reach 100% in accessibility since I liked the colour I chose from the begining. 
Here you can compare the accessibility fom my previous project to this one.
